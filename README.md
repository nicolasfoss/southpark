# Southpark
##Warning: the dataset in this project contains explicit language.##

South Park is a satiric American TV show that is popular around the world. In this Project, I combined two datasets: dialogs from the first 21 seasons (287 episodes) and IMDB ratings of these episodes. Using some text analysis principles, I answered questions like: Are naughtier episodes more popular? Is Eric Cartman the naughtiest character in the show?
